## Shiny Presentation

========================================================

- This simple calculator get two input numbers and one operator, then show you the result automatically!

- It is interactive. You can try:)

## Basic about the calculator

========================================================

- The operators include adding, subtracting, multiplication and division.

- Numbers need to be input or press the arrow button to choose.

- It can count integerï¼Œfractional and negative numbers.


## The calculator! Try me:)

## Futher discussion

========================================================

- It can add another features like sin, cos, square, square root and so on in the future.
- It can add some error control hints in the future.
- It can add memory and clear features.
